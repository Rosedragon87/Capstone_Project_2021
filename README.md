# Capstone_Project_2021
A shared repo for data science bootcamp capstone project
## Selected topic: What lifestyle or socioeconomic factors can help predict diabetes.
### We chose this topic because we found a robust dataset that should help us achieve our goals.
## Description of data
### Our data has over 250,000 records and 22 columns. This data is from the 2015 health survey conducted annually by the CDC. 
## Questions we hope to answer with the data
### With this large of a dataset we hope to see what factors can predict diabetes. Secondarily we want to examine how the results are affected by age and gender.
## Technologies we will use:
* Github for collaboration.
* Postgres for our database.
* Supervised learning using regression to explore the data.
* Tableau for our dashboard.
## Machine Learning
For the machine learning aspect of this project we have decided to use multiple different methods. The main one being the EasyEnsembleClassifier as this is what produced the highest balanced accuracy scored in module 17. One of the benefits to using this method is that it helps eliminate bias from the model.
