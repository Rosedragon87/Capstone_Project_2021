# Capstone_Project_2021
A shared repo for data science bootcamp capstone project
## Selected topic: What lifestyle or socioeconomic factors can help predict diabetes.
### We chose this topic because we found a robust dataset that should help us achieve our goals.
## Description of data
### Our data has over 250,000 records and 22 columns. This data is from the 2015 health survey conducted annually by the CDC. 
## Questions we hope to answer with the data
### With this large of a dataset we hope to see what factors can predict diabetes. Secondarily we want to examine how the results are affected by age and gender.
## Technologies we will use:
* Github for collaboration.
* Postgres for our database.
* Supervised learning using regression to explore the data.
* Tableau for our dashboard.
## Machine Learning
For the machine learning aspect of this project, we have decided to use the supervised learning method. This method is used for labeled datasets as a way to classify the data and predict requested outcomes. Supervised machine learning seems to be the best fit for the dataset as we will be using regression in order to assess which factors correlate most significantly with the outcome to our topic of which lifestyle and socioeconomic factors help predict diabetes. EasyEnsembleClassifier produced the highest balanced accuracy score in module 17 which leads us to believe it will be the most effective method to use. One of the benefits to using this classifier is that it helps eliminate bias from the model. We will be using a number of different classifiers/methods in order to ensure the ones we are using best contribute to answering our topic question.
